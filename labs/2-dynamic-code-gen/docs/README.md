Some readings:
  - `Arm_EE382N_4.pdf`: overview of ARM assembly.
  - `subroutines.hohl-arm-asm.pdf` annoted overview of subroutine calls --- explains
    the different load instructions and procedure call conventions.
  - `IHI0042F_aapcs.pdf`: the official ARM register and procedure passing document.
    Includes a bunch of other things we don't care about (for the moment) so you have
    to skim.
