## Lab: digital devices

Today we are going to implement a bunch of digital devices from
datasheets.  After this class, datasheets will be your primary contact
with devices, so it's good to get used to reading them.

***I'm still writing this lab, so only part 0 is currently checked in.  The others will
come out during the lab session.  Apologies...***

We'll do the following:
  
  0. [0-pullup](0-pullup/README.md): Write the code to set a GPIO pin to pull 
     up / pull down.

  1. [allegro a1104 hall effect sensor](1-hall-effect) that tells
     you when a magnet is touching it.

  2. [Mechanical relay that you can use to turn on larger voltages](2-relay/README.md)

  3. [hc-sr04 sonar device](3-sonar/README.md)  which uses sound to measure distance.

PRELAB:

  - [How to use a multimeter](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-multimeter/all).
  - [How to use a breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all).

Checkoff:
   1. Show your devices work.
   2. Do some kind of trick that combines them.
